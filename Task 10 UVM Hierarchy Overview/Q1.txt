Q1- What is the difference between objects, components and transaction ?

-- Objects: Used for stimulus modeling (transactions)
            NO hierarchy 
            During the simulation, many objects will be created when required, and once used they will be disappeared

-- components: Used to build the test bench structure 
               Model TB hierarchy
               Static-like (Quasi-Static) structure that are created during run time & they are presistent throughout the simulation.

-- transaction: it is object, uvm seq_item extends transaction parent class .
